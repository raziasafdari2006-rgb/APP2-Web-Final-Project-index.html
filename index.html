                <p> Blackpink (Korean: 블랙핑크, stylized in all caps or as BLΛƆKPIИK) is a South Korean girl group formed by YG Entertainment. The group is composed of four members: Jisoo, Jennie, Rosé, and Lisa. Regarded by various publications as the "biggest girl group in the world", they are recognized as a leading force in the Korean Wave and an ambassador of the "girl crush" concept in K-pop, which explores themes of self-confidence and female empowerment.

                Blackpink debuted in August 2016 with their single album Square One, which included "Whistle", their first number-one hit on South Korea's Circle Digital Chart, and "Boombayah", their first number-one on the US Billboard World Digital Songs chart. Three months later, they released another single album, Square Two, whose song "Playing with Fire" was the first by a Korean girl group to enter the Billboard Canadian Hot 100. The group's domestic and global popularity grew with the chart-topping single "Ddu-Du Ddu-Du" (2018), the first song by a Korean female group to enter the UK Singles Chart and receive a certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Its music video was the first by a Korean group to surpass one and two billion views on YouTube. Their music videos for "Kill This Love" (2019) and "How You Like That" (2020) set records for the most-viewed music videos within the first 24 hours of release; the latter topped the Circle Digital Chart and set five Guinness World Records. </p>
